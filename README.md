# ðŸ˜Ž Portfolio Website

This web application was crafted using react atomic design pattern to maintain a better project organization.
I used Tailwind Framework since it's a friendly tool to construct awesome web apps and of course React library
to breakdown the web in diverse components.

Adittionaly, I use Github Pages Service to host it, I highly recommend using that tool to showcase your work.
